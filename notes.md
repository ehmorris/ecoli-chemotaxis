# Notes 4/19/22

- Motors can appear on top and bottom edges

- cheY needs to dock faster with receptors
- Can phospohralted cheY stick to receptors? Right now they don't

- Should the number of cheY or attractant required to "flip" the receptors and motors be proportional to the number of entities?

- Should phosphorylation wear off after some timeout? As-is, cheY MUST bind to a motor to become dephosphorylated

## Polish

- Motor animation
- Draw the edge of the e coli
- Edge bounce behavior needs to be a reflected bounce
- Illustrations for entities
- Video of real entity

## Minor

- Would be nice to fix the hot reload issue just for annoyance-sake
