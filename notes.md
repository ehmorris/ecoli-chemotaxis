# Notes 9/16/22

- Paths for motors, receptors, and attractant
  - Effects, like the focus-plane blurring of the run/tumble GIF
- Some kind of illustrative background texture / noise similar to run/tumble GIF
- Scale everything up / make responsive
- Motors should animate / rotate, and change direction depending on state
- Docked state of cheY on receptor and motor should be more illustrative
  - Plus attractant
- Motors should appear on top and bottom edges
- Import improved tiny graph from lunar lander
- UI should be for attractant only and not cheY, make UI nicer also

## Methylation and bio questions next steps:

- Should the number of cheY or attractant required to "flip" the receptors and motors be proportional to the number of entities?
- Should phosphorylation wear off after some timeout? As-is, cheY MUST bind to a motor to become dephosphorylated
- Can phospohralted cheY stick to receptors? Right now they don't
