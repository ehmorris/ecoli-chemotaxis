    <h1>
      The baffling intelligence of a single cell: the story of E. coli
      chemotaxis
    </h1>
    <h2>By James Somers and Edwin Morris</h2>

    <article>
      <p>
        I want to tell the story of a beautiful phenomenon in biology. In some
        sense it’s the prototype of much of the activity of life. The phenomenon
        is the way in which an individual cell of E. coli forages for nutrients.
        This process, known as “chemotaxis”—the “chemo-” for chemical and the
        “taxis” from the Greek τάξις for “tactics”—is intelligence in one of its
        most elemental forms. An individual E. coli has no brain, obviously, and
        is even many orders of magnitude simpler than a human cell, and yet
        already it possesses something like a sense of smell, drive, even a
        memory. Chemotaxis recasts E. coli not as some aimless gut-pest but
        rather as an exquisitely sophisticated physical computer. [Bray]
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also telling this story because
        <a href="https://jsomers.net/i-should-have-loved-biology"
          >I never liked the way biology was taught in high school</a
        >. It was too much about the names of things. A subject so vast is
        spoiled by a textbook, which can only point, rotely, at the endless
        parade of stuff-there-is-to-know. It’s better approached in thin, deep
        slices. Chemotaxis is a great slice: it’s a triumph of systems
        biology—we understand it as a whole but also in fine detail at almost
        every level. It acquaints you with many of the most important motifs in
        biology: the way in which protein structure determines function; how
        membranes control the information flow into cells; and how chemical
        modifications store and communicate state. It involves one of the most
        sophisticated and beautiful pieces of molecular nanotechnology, the
        flagellar motor. And it helps give an intuition for how a bag of
        unthinking chemicals could possibly give rise to a being.

      <h4>The 30,000-foot view</h4>
      <p>
        The basic idea is this: E. coli “smells” chemicals it’s attracted to
        with a set of nose-like receptors on its front. If attractant is
        present, it uses its flagellar tails to swim forward—this is known as a
        “run”—and otherwise it spins in a random direction (a “tumble”). By
        running when the getting is good and tumbling when it isn’t, the E. coli
        takes a meandering path toward the attractant.
